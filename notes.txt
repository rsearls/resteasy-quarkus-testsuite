- Quarkus 1.9.0.Final has a memory leak.  An OutOfMemoryError occurs about 183 tests
        into the test set (441 test files).  From a heapdump the offending
        object is io.quarkus.bootstrap.classloading.QuarkusClassLoader.
   # This project has been configured to force a heapDump by test, ContextProvidersTest,
     because settings as a system property and in maven were ignored.

- Quarkus 1.8.2 has a memory leak.  An OutOfMemoryError occurs about 195 tests
       into the test set (479 test files).  From a heapdump the offending
       object is io.quarkus.bootstrap.classloading.QuarkusClassLoader.
- Must use JDK 8 version with quarkus 1.8.2.Final to avoid failure do to
    jdk-9 org.apache.logging.log4j.util.StackLocator$FqcnCallerLocator issue.
- quarkus 1.8.2.Final BOM uses RESTEasy 4.5.6.Final. Resteasy version set
        in ./pom.xml and integration-tests/pom.xml
- quarkus 1.8.2.Final BOM declares org.jboss.threads:jboss-threads:3.2.0.Final
        RESTEasy by way of wfly uses org.jboss.threads:jboss-threads:2.3.2.Final.
        Version org.jboss.threads:jboss-threads:3.2.0.Final no longer contains
        org.jboss.threads.AsyncFuture, hence several RESTEasy tests fail.
        Only solution is to remove those tests because the failures cause a
        "java.net.BindException: Address already in use" of subsequent tests.
