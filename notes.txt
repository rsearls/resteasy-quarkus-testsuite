    org/jboss/resteasy/test/resource/basic/MediaTypeNegotiationServerQualityTest.java
    and org/jboss/resteasy/test/resource/basic/MediaTypeNegotiationClientQualityTest.java
    -- cause of failure
        The test sets path to "echo".  There is no endpoint @Path("echo").   It seems
        it is captured by undertow and responded to.  Quarkus does not recognize
        this path and does not response similarly.

    org/jboss/resteasy/test/resource/basic/DefaultMediaTypeTest.java
    -- cause of failure
        Quarkus does not support annotation @Category.  The 2 tests that use it
        fail.  All other tests in class pass.

    org/jboss/resteasy/test/providers/multipart/InputPartDefaultContentTypeWildcardOverwriteNewInterceptorTest.java

        Quarkus does not find the MessageBodyReader for media type:

    -- cause of failure
        This test generates a web.xml file with context-params.  Quarkus
        does not process web.xml content.  This test will always fail.

    org/jboss/resteasy/test/resource/basic/ResourceInfoInjectionTest.java
    -- cause of failure
      Undertows classes ServletInputStreamImpl (line 241) and ServletContextImpl
      (line 188) are used to call the endpoints implementation inputStream method,
      onDataAvailable().  For some reason this under laying code is calling this
      method twice.  It should only be called once.  The first call writes the
      outputStream properly.  The 2nd call reads -1 data.  The write to outputStream
      generates an ArrayOutOfBounds exceptions.  This detail is not reported instead
      an HTTP 500 error is reported to the client.  It is unclear why there are
      2 read attempts.

    org/jboss/resteasy/test/resource/basic/ParameterSubResTest.java
    -- cause of failure
        Class ParameterSubResClassSub has @Inject annotations for class variables.
        Quarkus creates class but does not perform the injections.  This causes
        A NullPointException to be generated.

    org/jboss/resteasy/test/validation/cdi/SubresourceValidationTest.java
    -- cause of failure
      Because of the way quarkus creates class SubresourceValidationSubResource,
      NOT as a proxy class.  Validation reports a property validation error on
      "y" in addition to the 2 parameter validation issues.  This is reported
      as a test failure.  Other than that the test is functioning normally.

    org/jboss/resteasy/test/security/CustomForbiddenMessageTest.java
    -- cause of failure
        Annotation javax.annotation.security.DenyAll is not handled by quarkus.

    org.jboss.resteasy.test.security.BasicAuthTest
    -- cause of failure
      Does not handle security code.

    and org/jboss/resteasy/test/response/PublisherResponseRawStreamTest.java
    and org/jboss/resteasy/test/response/AnotherPublisherResponseTest.java
    -- cause of failure
      When run in quarkus stack in ThreadLocalStack already has 1 element in it.
      This throws off the expected return value.   Other than that this test
      runs OK.

    org/jboss/resteasy/test/response/HeadContentLengthTest.java
    -- cause of failure
      When HEAD is called the endpoint and value returned.  Vertx returns
      Content-length 0.

   org/jboss/resteasy/test/providers/multipart/EmbeddedMultipartTest.java
   -- cause of failure
     Provider JAXBXmlRootElementProvider is never loaded.  It may not be
     in the classpath.

   org/jboss/resteasy/test/interceptor/GZIPAnnotationTest.java
   -- cause of failure
    This is an issue with GZIPEncodingIntercetor$EnableGZIPOutputStream
    writing data. The string "test" is converted to byte[] (116,101,115,116]
    is written as byte[] (31,-117,8)

    org.jboss.resteasy.test.injection.PostConstructInjectionTest
       -- cause of failure
        Quarkus not mapping a declared @Interceptors class
        (e.g. PostConstructInjectionEJBInterceptor is declared with class level
          @Interceptor.  PostConstructInjectionEJBResource references that class
          using @Interceptors. )

- Quarkus 1.9.0.Final
    - does not support multiple classes with @ApplicationPath.
    - Still issue support 2 Json annotations.
    - Does not support @TargetsContainer.
    - Can not find org.apache.logging.log4j.util.StackLocator.
    - Does not support CDI qualifiers=[@Default, @Any]

- Quarkus 1.9.0.Final has a memory leak.  An OutOfMemoryError occurs about 183 tests
        into the test set (441 test files).  From a heapdump the offending
        object is io.quarkus.bootstrap.classloading.QuarkusClassLoader.
   # This project has been configured to force a heapDump by test, ContextProvidersTest,
     because settings as a system property and in maven were ignored.

-- Oct 16, 2020
- Quarkus 1.8.2 has a memory leak.  An OutOfMemoryError occurs about 195 tests
       into the test set (479 test files).  From a heapdump the offending
       object is io.quarkus.bootstrap.classloading.QuarkusClassLoader.
- Must use JDK 8 version with quarkus 1.8.2.Final to avoid failure do to
    jdk-9 org.apache.logging.log4j.util.StackLocator$FqcnCallerLocator issue.
- quarkus 1.8.2.Final BOM uses RESTEasy 4.5.6.Final. Resteasy version set
        in ./pom.xml and integration-tests/pom.xml
- quarkus 1.8.2.Final BOM declares org.jboss.threads:jboss-threads:3.2.0.Final
        RESTEasy by way of wfly uses org.jboss.threads:jboss-threads:2.3.2.Final.
        Version org.jboss.threads:jboss-threads:3.2.0.Final no longer contains
        org.jboss.threads.AsyncFuture, hence several RESTEasy tests fail.
        Only solution is to remove those tests because the failures cause a
        "java.net.BindException: Address already in use" of subsequent tests.
